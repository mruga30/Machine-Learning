# Problem Set 3
In this set, I have used Linear regression on the data set and used cross-validation to analyze the results.  
In addition to computing and applying the close-form solution, also implemented from scratch a gradient descent algorithm for linear regression.  
The code is written in MATLAB and Data Set: http://cvc.cs.yale.edu/cvc/projects/yalefaces/yalefaces.html  

#### hw2_part2
Closed form solution of Linear Regression.

#### hw2_part3
Used S-folds Cross Validation with Linear Regression.

#### hw2_part4
Locally weighted Linear Regression.

#### hw2_part5
Gradient descent used to find the parameters for Linear Regression.
