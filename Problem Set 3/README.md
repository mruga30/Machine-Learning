# Problem Set 3
In this set, I have done classification and designed a Naive Bayes classifier. In addition, used an SVM package of and performed multi-class classification using a binary classifier.  
The code is written in MATLAB and Spambase Data Set: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Spambase and CTG Data Set: http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Cardiotocography.  

#### hw3_part2
Naive-Bayes Classifier to classify Spam or Not Spam Dataset.

#### hw3_part3
Decision Tree to classify Spam or Not Spam Dataset.

#### hw3_part4
Used both Naive Bayes and Decision Tree for multi-class classification.
